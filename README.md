# SR Linux Controller for KNE

This is a k8s controller for running and managing SR Linux nodes launched from [openconfig/kne](https://github.com/openconfig/kne) topology.

Built with [kubebuilder v3.8.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases/tag/v3.8.0).

## Install

To install the latest version of this controller on a cluster referenced in `~/.kube/config`, issue the following command:

```bash
# latest version
kubectl apply -k https://github.com/srl-labs/srl-controller/config/default

# specific version (using git reference, e.g. tag or commit)
kubectl apply -k https://github.com/srl-labs/srl-controller/config/default?ref=v0.3.1
```

The resources of this controller will be scoped under `srlinux-controller` namespace.

```text
❯ kubectl get all -n srlinux-controller

```

### Installing from a repo

The controller can be installed with make directly from the repo:

```text
make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/srl-labs/srl-controller:0.3.1
```

Make sure to check which controller versions are [available](https://github.com/srl-labs/srl-controller/pkgs/container/srl-controller/versions).

## Uninstall

To uninstall the controller from the cluster:

```text
kubectl delete -k https://github.com/srl-labs/srl-controller/config/default
```

## Testing with `kne` & `kind`

To run the released version of the controller in a test cluster deployed with [`kne`](https://github.com/openconfig/kne) and [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) follow the steps outlined in the [KNE repository](https://github.com/openconfig/kne/tree/main/docs).

Once the kne+kind cluster is created and the `srl-controller` is installed onto it, a [demo topology with two SR Linux nodes](https://github.com/openconfig/kne/blob/db5fe5be01a1b6b65bd79e740e2c819c5aeb50b0/examples/srlinux/2node-srl-with-config.pbtxt) can be deployed as follows:

```bash
kne create examples/srlinux/2node-srl-with-config.pbtxt
```

Note, that controller logs can be viewed live with:

```bash
kubectl logs --follow -n srlinux-controller $(kubectl get pods -A | grep srlinux-controller | awk '{print $2}')
```

This will deploy the SR Linux nodes and will create k8s services as per the topology configuration. The services will be exposed via MetalLB and can be queried as:

```text
❯ kubectl -n 3node-srlinux get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                      AGE
service-r1   LoadBalancer   10.96.151.84    172.19.0.50   57400:30006/TCP,443:30004/TCP,22:30005/TCP   6m10s
service-r2   LoadBalancer   10.96.34.36     172.19.0.51   443:30010/TCP,22:30011/TCP,57400:30009/TCP   6m9s
```

To connect with SSH to the `r1` node, use `ssh admin@172.19.0.50` command.

### Loading images to kind cluster

[Public SR Linux container image](https://github.com/nokia/srlinux-container-image) will be pulled by kind automatically if Internet access is present. Images that are not available publicly can be uploaded to kind manually:

```bash
# default kne kind cluster name is `kne`
# which is the last argument in the command

# load locally available container image
kind load docker-image srlinux:0.0.0-38566 --name kne

# load publicly available container image
kind load docker-image ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux:22.6.4 --name kne
```

## Using license files

To remove the packets-per-second limit of a public container image or to launch chassis-based variants of SR Linux (ixr-6e/10e) KNE users should provide a valid license file to the `srl-controller`.

Navigate to [Using license files](docs/using-licenses.md) document to have a detailed explanation on that topic.

## Controller operations

The controller is designed to manage the `Srlinux` custom resource defined with [the following CRD](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/srl-labs/srl-controller).

The request to create/delete a resource of kind `Srlinux` is typically coming from `openconfig/kne` topology.

### Creation

When a request to create a `Srlinux` resource named `r1` in namespace `ns` comes in, the controller's reconcile loop does the following:

1. Checks if the pods exist within a namespace `ns` with a name `r1`
2. If the pod hasn't been found, then the controller first ensures that the necessary config maps exist in namespace `ns` and creates them otherwise.
3. When config maps are sorted out, the controller schedules a pod with the name `r1` and requeue the request
4. In a requeue run, the pod is now found and the controller updates the status of `Srlinux` resource with the image name that was used in the pod spec.

### Deletion

When a deletion happens on `Srlinux` resource, the reconcile loop does nothing.

### API access

This repo contains a clientset for API access to the `Srlinux` custom resource. Check [kne repo](https://github.com/openconfig/kne/blob/fc195a73035bcbf344791979ca3e067be47a249c/topo/node/srl/srl.go#L46) to see how this can be done.

## Building `srl-controller` container image

To build `srl-controller` container image, execute:

```bash
# don't forget to set the correct tag
# for example make docker-build IMG=ghcr.io/srl-labs/srl-controller:0.4.3
make docker-build IMG=ghcr.io/srl-labs/srl-controller:${tag}
```

> build process will try to remove license headers for some manifests, discard those changes.

Next update the controller version in [manager/kustomization.yaml](config/manager/kustomization.yaml) kustomization file to match the newly built version.

Finally, upload the container image to the registry:

```bash
docker push ghcr.io/srl-labs/srl-controller:${tag}

# if this is the latest version, also push it with the `latest` tag
docker tag ghcr.io/srl-labs/srl-controller:${tag} ghcr.io/srl-labs/srl-controller:latest
docker push ghcr.io/srl-labs/srl-controller:latest
```

## Developers guide

Developers should deploy the controller onto a cluster from the source code. Ensure that the `srl-controller` is [uninstalled](#uninstall) from the cluster before proceeding.

The cluster should be deployed with the `kne` cli utility. First, make sure to remove the controller section from kne's `kind-bridge.yaml` file so that controllers are not installed automatically, as we will install srl-controller from the source code.

```bash
kne deploy deploy/kne/kind-bridge.yaml
```

Install the Srlinux CRDs onto the cluster

```
make install
```

To build and run the controller from the source code:

```
make run
```

Controller's log printed to stdout/stderr. It is possible to deploy topologies with `kne create` now.

Make changes to the controller code-base, and re-run `make run` to see the changes in effect.
